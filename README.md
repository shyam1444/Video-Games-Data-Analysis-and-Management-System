# Video Games Data Analysis and Management System

This project is a Python-based application designed to visualize and manage a comprehensive dataset of video game information. By integrating Python with MySQL, the system allows users to efficiently analyze and interact with extensive video game data.

## Features

- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes Python libraries to create insightful visual representations of the video game dataset.
- **Database Management**: Employs MySQL to handle data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, ensuring efficient data management.
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Includes a vast collection of video game data, facilitating in-depth analysis and exploration.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shyam1444/Video-Games-Data-Analysis-and-Management-System.git
   ```


2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Video-Games-Data-Analysis-and-Management-System
   ```


3. **Install Required Python Libraries**:

   Ensure you have `pip` installed. Then, execute:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


4. **Set Up the MySQL Database**:

   - Install MySQL Server if it's not already installed.
   - Create a new database named `video_games_db`.
   - Import the `games.csv` data into the `video_games_db` database.

5. **Configure Database Connection**:

   Update the database connection settings in the Python scripts to match your MySQL configuration (e.g., username, password, host, and database name).

## Usage

After completing the installation steps:

1. **Run the Application**:

   Execute the main Python script to start the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```


2. **Explore Data**:

   Use the application's interface to visualize and analyze the video game data.
